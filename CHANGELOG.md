# Changelog

## [2023-11-12] - Optimization Phase Enhancement and Report Generation

### Added
- Comprehensive REPORT.md with detailed analysis of all compiler phases
- Key findings and recommendations section to the report
- Detailed documentation of the optimization capabilities

### Changed
- Refactored optimization.c to use LLVM's PassBuilder API for optimizations
- Fixed memory management in the optimization report generation to prevent segmentation faults
- Enhanced the optimization report with more detailed statistics

### Fixed
- Segmentation fault in generate_optimization_report function
- Improved null pointer handling in report generation
- Enhanced memory cleanup with proper goto-based error handling

## Testing and Verification
- Verified strength reduction optimization successfully converts multiplication by powers of 2 to bit shifts
- Confirmed constant folding works correctly in simple test cases
- Identified function call resolution issues that require future attention

## Future Work
- Fix function call handling in the IR generator
- Enhance symbol table implementation for proper function resolution
- Expand optimization capabilities with more advanced techniques
